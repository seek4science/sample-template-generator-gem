[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/seek4science/sample-template-generator-gem/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/seek4science/sample-template-generator-gem)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seek4science/sample-template-generator-gem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seek4science/sample-template-generator-gem)


A very simple prototype of generating an Excel Template based upon Sample Type information in [SEEK](http://seekscience.org)

This is currently very basic and scruffy prototyping work.

SEEK is developed as part of [FAIRDOM](http://fair-dom.org)

SEEK github repository can be found at https://github.com/seek4science/seek

FAIRDOM runs the [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org) which is a public instance of SEEK for scientific research
