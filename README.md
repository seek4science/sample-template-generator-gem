# Sample Template Generator

A very simple prototype of generating an Excel Template based upon Sample Type information in [SEEK](http://seekscience.org)

This is currently very basic and scruffy prototyping work.

SEEK is developed as part of [FAIRDOM](http://fair-dom.org)

SEEK github repository can be found at https://github.com/seek4science/seek

FAIRDOM runs the [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org) which is a public instance of SEEK for scientific research
